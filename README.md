# Human-Violence-Detection-Model
Automated human violence detection in video surveillance is essential for
enhancing security and preventing crime. This study presents a deep learning-based
approach using a Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN) to classify
video sequences into two categories: violence and non-violence. The model
leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract spatial features and
long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to capture temporal dependencies,
ensuring accurate recognition of violent activities. We train the model on a curated
dataset with data augmentation and transfer learning techniques to enhance
generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high
accuracy in classifying video sequences into the two categories. The proposed
system can be integrated into real-time surveillance frameworks to enable
automated violence detection and assist security personnel in timely intervention.

#Violence and Nonviolenvce datasets are available on kaggle.
